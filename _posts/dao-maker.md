## Introduction
DAO Maker is building the go-to platform for retail venture investing in equity and tokens. Providing low-risk participation frameworks is essential to reach global retail in venture capital, as most retail investors cannot afford to risk large portions of their money. By providing an opportunity to everyday people to safely grow their own capital, we aim to improve the quality of millions of lives while simultaneously enabling a new funding source to innovation worldwide.

## Features
1. Non Inflationary Staking APY
2. DAO Maker takes a multi-pronged approach towards enabling the Success of its Partners.
3. DAO Maker is composed of several arms and Social Mining operations are just one of them.
4. The token's role in the project must offer meaningful incentives for the community to not just hold tokens, but acquire more of them with avid interest through either purchase or Social Mining.
