## About RET

1. More than ever, our world is under threat with heavy dependence on fossil fuels, especially oil and coal. Air pollution, environmental degradation and climate change are the result of this dependence. Unprecedented global warming, rising forest fires, melting glaciers and rising sea levels are some of the problems caused by the excessive use of non-renewable energy. The Ret team intends to break this dependence on non-renewable energy. To this end, creating physical projects to use wind and solar energy is one of the team's future plans. Creating physical projects, in addition to helping to protect the environment, will also benefit Ret holders.

2. RET holders can receive up to 1% of the transaction amount equal to their own balance as a reward without doing anything and just keeping it in their wallets.

## Goals

1. One of the important goals of the team is to involve Ret holders in the profits from the creation of physical projects. Ret holders are therefore the future shareholders of the company.

2. Another goals of RET is to create a game in the field of renewable power plants and familiarize people with it. The player will earn money for himself by creating a power plant and installing renewable energy equipment while playing an exciting game.
