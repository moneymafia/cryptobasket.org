## Introduction

The first Play to earn game in Avalanche ecosystem, using NFT's as in game assets. Get your unique snail, compete in races, breed more snails and earn SMILE. Much like Humans every snail has a unique genes. In-game system allow for billions of different genetic sequence, multiple generations and rare species.

## Features

1. Snail owners can earn rewards by entering races and tournaments on the platform, all available in real time for watching.
2. Comprehensive in-game reproduction systems allow owners to mint ready to race new offsprings.
3. Mint a Genesis Snail and start your racing journey as you compete against other snails in high stakes Competitive Races or fun Daily Missions.


## Snail Overview

1. A snail belongs to one of five different families: Garden, Helix, Milk, Agate, or the rarest of the snail families; Atlantis.
2. Genesis Class snails will be available to mint before the game launch while the other 6 classes will be available in-game.
3. The generation of a snail represents how far down a snail is from the first ancestor on its family tree.
4. All snails adapt in a unique way to their environment and each one receives an adaptation at random when it is born.


## Racing Traits

Every Snail is unique. Their performance is defined by 4 different traits which we'll cover in more depth below.

1. Family :
Snails can belong to one of 5 different families.

1. Each family has a different letter assigned for its gene.
2. Each snail has 20 genes in its genome. The most dominant gene determines its family.
3. Both parents randomly pass on 10 genes to the offspring's genetic sequence. For each slot only one parent can provide a gene. For instance, for a Nth slot gene, it can either be female parent's Nth slot gene or male parent's Nth slot gene. See the related image in DNA page.
4. While the quantity of genes is important for reproduction, its order in the genetic sequence is not changing the family type.

2. Class:
Snails can fall under one of the following 7 classes.

1. Master, Expert, Apprentice, Initiate, and Novice classes will be available in-game anytime.
2. Genesis and Special classes will be minted to specific users for a specific time period.

3. Generation: 
The generation of a snail represents how far down a snail is from the first ancestor on its family tree. A snail can be brought to Earth in two different ways: as an Incubator or a Laboratory snail.

4. Adaption: 
Each snail adapts in a unique way to its environment. However, this does not mean that a Cold Adaptive Snail never performs well in Hot conditions. On average it achieves better results in cold conditions than in any of the other environments.

1. At birth, each snail has only 1 adaptation.
2. Throughout life, a snail can adapt to a total of up to 3 different environments. Increasing adaptation is possible with Adaptation Potion.
3. Each Trail can have several conditions which might change on every segment of the trail.
