## Introduction

Takemichi Inu is an Anime project focused launchpad in which the $TAKE token will also act as the governance token for projects that we vet, incubate and launch in the future. The growth of crypto and micro cap tokens has led to a crowded, fast moving space that makes it hard for investors to maintain confidence in investing in and holding new and upcoming projects Takemichi, through its launchpad ($TAKE) aims to provide a safe place for its holders to be able to diversify their portfolios without having to worry about scams.

## Features

1. Takemichi Inu has developed improved methods of ensuring the health and safety of any newly vetted project.
2. Takemichi Inu, and it’s native $TAKE token, seek to expand and improve upon the traditional structure of a Launchpad by creating innovative methods of incubating, releasing, and marketing new projects.
3. Using a combined system of random lottery, token airdrops, and tailored whitelisting, the Takemichi Inu launchpad is like nothing you have ever seen before. 
4. The integration of Manji Swap in to the Takemichi Inu ecosystem creates a one stop shop to trade, earn, and most importantly keep investors SAFE!


## OUR MISSION

Takemichi Inu is an ERC-20 launchpad focused on providing vetted, safe ERC-20 project launches in which the $TAKE token serves as the primary method of access. Through owning and staking $TAKE, holders gain access to trusted projects by means of vetted Pre-Sales, Whitelisted Fair Launches, and early access to Stealth Launches. Regular buybacks and redistribution of $TAKE tokens are performed by means of income derived from launches incubated through the launchpad. Takemichi Inu, and it’s native $TAKE token, seek to expand and improve upon the traditional structure of a Launchpad by creating innovative methods of incubating, releasing, and marketing new projects.


By identifying the failures and successes of previous ERC-20 launchpads, the team at Takemichi Inu has developed improved methods of ensuring the health and safety of any newly vetted project. Through various creative measures of allowing early access to projects to $TAKE holders, Takemichi Inu will revolutionize the term Launchpad! Owning and staking $TAKE gives holders passive income in the way of earning $TAKE tokens in addition to token allocations of newly launched projects and the innovative buyback system creates positive upward momentum for the $TAKE token while rewarding the community for participating in the Takemichi Inu ecosystem.
